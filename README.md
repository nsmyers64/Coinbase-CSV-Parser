# Coinbase-CSV-Parser
A parser to take the auto generated CSV files from Coinbase and extract gain/loss and fee totals from the file. 

I made this program to help simplify the process of doing taxes on cryptocurrency through coinbase. This allowed me to do the hundreds of calculations all at once instead of doing it by hand, and made doing my taxes far more efficient. It is a simple program, without a user freindly way to import files, and could be improved with a file selector, and more options for veiwing the data by custom values, along with sorting the data and other options.
